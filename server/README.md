## API Endpoints

- `/api/properties`: CRUD operations for property listings
- `/api/users`: User management and authentication
- `/api/appointments`: Scheduling and managing property viewings
- `/api/search`: Advanced property search and filtering

## Multi-language Support

- Implemented i18n for localization
- Support for multiple languages in property descriptions and API responses
- Language preference stored in user profiles

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication for secure API access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for allowed origins

## Performance Optimization

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Database indexing for faster queries
- Pagination for large data sets

## Scalability

- Implement load balancing for horizontal scaling
- Use a message queue for handling background tasks
- Consider microservices architecture for future expansion

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement centralized logging system
- Set up performance monitoring and alerting
- Error tracking and reporting

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with mapping services for property locations
- Virtual tour functionality
- Automated valuation model (AVM) for property price estimates
- Client feedback and rating system for properties and agents
- Real-time notifications for new listings and appointment updates
- Integration with third-party real estate platforms
