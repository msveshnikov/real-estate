# PropertyDetails Component Documentation

## Overview

The `PropertyDetails` component is a React functional component that displays detailed information about a specific property. It is part of a larger real estate application and is located in the `src/pages/PropertyDetails.js` file.

This component fetches property data based on an ID from the URL, displays loading states, and renders property information including images, price, features, and description. It also includes a feature to toggle the property as a favorite.

## Dependencies

- React
- React Router
- Material-UI (MUI)

## Component Structure

```jsx
const PropertyDetails = () => {
  // ... component logic
}
```

## State

The component uses the following state variables:

- `property`: Holds the fetched property data
- `loading`: Boolean to track the loading state
- `isFavorite`: Boolean to track if the property is marked as a favorite

## Hooks

### useParams

Used to extract the `id` parameter from the URL.

### useEffect

Used to fetch property data when the component mounts or when the `id` changes.

## Main Functions

### fetchProperty

An asynchronous function that simulates an API call to fetch property details. It uses a timeout to mimic a network request and sets mock data for demonstration purposes.

### handleFavoriteToggle

Toggles the `isFavorite` state when the user clicks the favorite button. (Note: Actual saving logic is not implemented)

## Rendering

The component renders different views based on the state:

1. Loading state: Displays a centered circular progress indicator
2. Error state: Shows a "Property not found" message if the property data is not available
3. Property details: Renders a grid layout with property information, including:
   - Main image
   - Title, price, and address
   - Bed, bath, and area information
   - Favorite toggle button
   - Description
   - Features list

## Usage

This component is typically used in conjunction with React Router. It expects a route parameter `id` to fetch the corresponding property details.

Example route setup:

```jsx
<Route path="/property/:id" element={<PropertyDetails />} />
```

## Notes

- The component currently uses mock data and simulated API calls. In a production environment, these should be replaced with actual API requests.
- The favorite functionality is not fully implemented and requires backend integration.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement actual API calls to fetch property data
2. Add error handling for failed API requests
3. Implement the full favorite toggling functionality with backend integration
4. Add image gallery functionality for multiple property images
5. Implement user authentication to personalize the favorite feature

## Related Components

- This component likely interacts with `PropertyCard` for navigation from search results or listings
- It may be linked from the `HomePage` or `SearchResults` pages

By providing detailed property information, this component plays a crucial role in the user's journey through the real estate application, allowing them to make informed decisions about properties of interest.
