## Design Considerations

-   Implement a design system for consistent UI components
-   Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
-   Implement skeleton screens for loading states
-   Add micro-interactions and animations for better UX
-   Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
-   Implement error boundaries for graceful error handling
-   Use React.Suspense and React.lazy for code splitting

## Performance Optimizations

-   Implement Redux with Redux Toolkit for efficient state management
-   Use React.memo and useMemo for component and value memoization
-   Implement service workers for offline support and faster load times
-   Use Intersection Observer API for lazy loading images
-   Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and code splitting
-   Implement server-side rendering for improved initial load time

## Future Enhancements

-   Integration with real estate APIs (e.g., Zillow, Realtor.com)
-   Interactive map view with clustering for property locations
-   360-degree virtual property tours
-   AI-powered chatbot for user inquiries
-   Mortgage calculator with personalized recommendations
-   User reviews and ratings for properties and agents
-   Advanced search with natural language processing
-   Property price prediction using machine learning
-   Integration with smart home devices for virtual home tours
-   Blockchain integration for secure property transactions
